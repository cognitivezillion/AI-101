Image Classification - MNIST Digit Recognition
The task of classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset is a fundamental introduction to machine learning and image classification. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit it represents. By creating a classification model for this task, you are essentially teaching a computer to recognize and differentiate between handwritten digits.
